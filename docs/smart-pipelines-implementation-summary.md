# 🤖 Smart Pipelines Implementation Summary

## Overview

I've successfully implemented the AI pipelines prompt by creating a comprehensive suite of **Smart Pipelines** specifically designed to assist with your OpenShift multi-cloud automation development. These pipelines are tailored to your current AWS development focus while preparing for future Azure and GCP expansion.

## 🎯 Implementation Approach
