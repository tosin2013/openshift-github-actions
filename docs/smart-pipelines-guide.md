4. **GitHub CLI**: Optional, for manual workflow triggering

### Required Secrets

#### Core Secrets (Required)
```bash
# GitHub repository secrets
GITHUB_TOKEN          # Automatically provided
```

#### Red Hat AI Services (Optional - for AI enhancement)
```bash
REDHAT_AI_API_KEY      # Your Red Hat AI Services API key
